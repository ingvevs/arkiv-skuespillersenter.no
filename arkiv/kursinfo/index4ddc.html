<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">WHY ARE WE DOING THIS?</span></strong></p>
<p>The Berlinale is one of the biggest A-list festivals in the world with a particular focus on actors as part of the film industry. This is one of the best platforms to network with the best talents in the industry worldwide.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the moment there is a noticeable trend and interest amongst the international industry to cast Nordic actors. <a href="http://www.ingridbb.com/news/latest/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.ingridbb.com/news/latest/', 'Ingrid Bolsø Berdal');">Ingrid Bolsø Berdal</a> and Ulrich Thomsen are just two of several Nordic actors who have impressed an international audience with their movie performances in 2014.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the issue at hand is that international casters complain that Nordic actors can be tricky to find. This is partly due to northeners not following the international guidelines for how to be visible on the market. Another problem is that Nordic actors often find it uncomfortable and awkward to network with strangers on their own. And regretfully, they are rarely supported by an agent or manager.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is important to react quickly and respond to the international interest. We believe that the Nordic countries have far more great actors with international potential to offer. We wish to support Nordic actors to network with the right industry professionals in order to enable further film collaborations across countries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is an exciting pilot project, which by success, could become an annual platform to showcase Nordic talents!</p>
