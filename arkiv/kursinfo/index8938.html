		<p><a href="../wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Proverom_300x2361.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-87" title="Proverom_300x236" src="../wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Proverom_300x2361.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="236" /></a>    Anna Gutto gjennomførte Prøverom med sitt Peer Gynt-prosjekt sammen med regissør John Gould Rubin og skuespillerne Ingvild Lien, Guri Glans, Sarah Wharton, Olli Wermskog og Henrik Berg Larsen.</p>
<p>"Our Oslo workshop for the Peer Gynt Project took place on August 16 at The Actors’ Center.  We had decided to devote the four hours we had to an investigation of the somewhat more mystical elements in the play; the scenes where Peer is faced with characters that seem to have some sense of his future, or control over it, or some fated relationship to the mechanics of life. So we focused on the Boyg, the Passenger and the Button Molder. We had in the room with us a combination of local actors who were invited to join in our work for the evening and actors who had been working on the project for some time and it was that combination in tandem with the flavor of a local Oslo environment that we hoped might lead us to some new insights into the play. Indeed, it did.</p>
<p><a href="../wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Knappest%c3%b8per-Anna-Gutto-Pr%c3%b8verom.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-465" title="Knappestøper Anna Gutto Prøverom" src="../wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Knappest%c3%b8per-Anna-Gutto-Pr%c3%b8verom.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>We began by working on the Boyg scene and shortly after the initial discussion began we discussed a production in Norway in which the same actor played the Boyg and Peer, as if the voice of the Boyg was coming from within Peer himself. We immediately embraced the heart of this idea, determined on two actors playing the one entity encompassing both characters, unified their gestures, had them work in Norwegian, and then framed them by objectifying translators who were progressively seated further and further out from the Boyg/Peer entity so as to fracture the audience’s experience of him.  The idea progressed and we mic-ed the Boyg/Peer unity to allow an internal monologue type of intimacy, while stretching the distance and vocalization of the translation. The space allowed us both the freedom to explore distance and to add technical multi-media elements ultimately including live-feed video, all of which gave us a far more expansive view of this scene than any of us came into the room with.</p>
<p>We were also able to make an important discovery through rehearsing newly written text - a monologue - in counterpoint to the Boyg scene.  This new monologue was a direct response to our co-creator/writer's experience meeting an ambitious young artist from Bergen, while traveling on a train in Norway.  The laughter of recognition in the room from the Norwegian performers as we worked the monologue taught us that we are finding something important about crossing cultures and about working together across cultural boundaries.  We saw as well that our vision of melding new text with Ibsen's original is compelling and worthwhile.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, the work on the Boyg grew into far more an investigation of character and less a pursuit of any media fracturing of the relationship between these two characters. Again we began with a discussion about the scene and the generally accepted ways the actors had scene it played. We quickly developed an interest in discovering a less overtly controlling Button Molder, which progressed into a search for a benign, then innocent, then naively young version of the character. These last pursuits grew out of a purely characteralogical pursuit of innocence within the actors involved; it was acting pure and simple. This allowed us to redefine the Button Molder to begin with, but then also to redefine Peer’s relationship to him and to develop a real progression in Peer’s comprehension of what and who the Button Molder was.  Again, as with the earlier scene with the Boyg, the room itself afforded us the opportunity to really manipulate the special relationships as the characters were changing and again this work allowed us to develop utterly fresh views of these scenes and the characters’ progressions in them.</p>
<p>This brief evening’s workshop was instrumental not only in allowing us to work with Norwegian actors on this text but also to allow us to investigate the confluence of Norwegian and English in the development of a complicated Boyg/Peer unity of character; it’s possible fractionalized multi-media expression and the density of Peer as a result. It also allowed us to find a new idea for the Button Molder and an unexpected medium for the delivery of fate. It was a crucial culmination to a week’s worth of surprises which altered us, and in turn allowed us to determine how we were then altered in our relationship to this play. Thank you."</p>
